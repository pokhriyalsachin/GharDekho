   - **React Router**: For handling routing and navigation within the application.
   - **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.

2. **Backend**
   - **Node.js**: The runtime environment for running JavaScript on the server side.
   - **Express.js**: The web framework for building the RESTful API.
   - **MongoDB**: The NoSQL database for storing user information, property listings, and other data.
   - **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB, used to define schemas and interact with the database.
   - **JSON Web Token (JWT)**: For secure user authentication and authorization.

3. **Deployment and DevOps**
   - **Heroku**: For deploying the backend server.
   - **Netlify**: For deploying the React frontend.
   - **GitHub**: For version control and collaborative development.

#### Development Process
1. **Planning and Design**
   - Initial planning involved defining the project scope, features, and technology stack.
   - Created wireframes and UI/UX designs using Figma to visualize the user interface.

2. **Frontend Development**
